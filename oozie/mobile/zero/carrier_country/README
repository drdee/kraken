mobile/zero/carrier_country

The carrier_country/coordinator.xml file has been abstracted in a
way that allows it to operate generically with any Wikipedia Zero related metric,
so long as it operates as a single pig script which takes and input and an output
argument.  The carrier vs. country coordinator.properties files only differ in the
pig script and output path that they use, and so are able to use the exact same
coordinator.xml and workflow.xml files.

For organizational sanity, I've moved the differnent .properties into a subdirectory
called 'properties/'.  If you need to add new Zero oozie coordinators that can use
the same job xml definitions, feel free to add them there.

I believe that I could abstract this Oozie Pig input/output pattern into a single
reusable definition, decoupled from any particular metric at all.  One thing
at a time though... :)
