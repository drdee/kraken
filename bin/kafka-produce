# A Kafka Producer wrapper that uses kafka-producer-shell.sh
# and /etc/kafka/producer.properties to produce messages from
# stdin into Kafka.  This also allows for setting JMX_PORT as
# the second argument.
#
# I wrote this wrapper so that I had a script in which I could
# set JMX_PORT, and use in udp2log config files while still
# reading from stdin.


# topic is the first arg, it is required.
topic=$1

test -z $topic && echo "Usage: $(basename $0) topic [jmx_port]" && exit 1

# by exporting JMX_PORT, kafka-run-class.sh will set
# -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port
export JMX_PORT=$2
